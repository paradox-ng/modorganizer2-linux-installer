# Mod Organizer 2 Linux Installer

This project aims to installing Mod Organizer 2 instances on Linux as easy as possible. It does that by providing installers which automatically setup a working experience for the user.

**This is a fork** of [rockerbacon's project](https://github.com/rockerbacon/modorganizer2-linux-installer). 

What started as a desire for Cyberpunk 2077 support post-archive grew into a full continuation of the project, keeping *everything* up to date including bug fixes and adding support for more games.

## Installing Mod Organizer 2

#### Requirements

The following requirements should be available out-of-the-box in most systems:
- _bash_
- either _curl_ or _wget_
- _zenity_
- _protontricks-launcher_: should be available after installing `protontricks` already, if not see [this](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks#desktop)</br>

You may need to manually install the following programs:
- _7z_
    - Should be readily available in your distribution's package manager
- _protontricks_
    - **Steam Deck users**: Protontricks must be installed through the Discover app.
    - **Other distributions**: carefully read through the [available install methods](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks#installation) to ensure you're using an up-to-date version of the program.

#### Installation Steps
1. Install the game you want to play on Steam;
2. Download the the latest stable release [here](https://github.com/furglitch/modorganizer2-linux-installer/releases/latest). If you wish to mod Oblivion Remastered, download the latest prerelease version.
- ⚠️ Prerelease versions use an in-development version of MO2. If you have issues after installation, report it to the MO2 team [directly](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/issues). If you're having issues with the install script, report it here.
3. Extract the downloaded file;
4. Open the extracted folder in a terminal and execute `./install.sh`;
5. The installer will start and guide you through the rest of the process;
6. Run the game on Steam and Mod Organizer 2 should start;
7. Read the [post-install instructions](post-install.md) for recommended additional steps;

The installer will automatically configure game-specific workarounds and install the script extender for your game of choice. Java binaries are also made available at `C:\java` for running Proc Patchers.

**Avoid using ENBoost** with Skyrim: DXVK and Wine have their own better working memory patches, both properly enabled with this installer.
